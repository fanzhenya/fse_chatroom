## Implementation

- Frontend: bootstrap, jquery
  - Login/Register and Chatroom page are in one same html to avoid reloading. 
  - they are made visible/invisible with js depending on current status.
  - dynamically modify html content based on the data received from server
  
- Backend: node.js, express, socket.io, sqlite, promise
  - build up a web server with express
  - back-end and front-end exchange events/data via web sockets 
  - persist user info and message history with sqlite
  - use promise style programming to avoid `callback hell`
